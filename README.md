# 👋 Hi, I'm Tatsuya Baba (bbtty6981-png)

I'm building my career as a backend/API engineer while working on practical projects using  
**Flask / Docker / AWS EC2 / REST API design**.  
Currently developing and deploying small but production-oriented APIs to strengthen my portfolio  
and prepare for freelance / side-job (副業) opportunities.

---

## 🚀 Skills & Technologies

- **Backend / API**: Python, Flask, REST API
- **Infrastructure / Ops**: Docker, docker-compose, AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Deployment**: Linux, systemd, containerized deployment

## 📦 Featured Project: Flask API Portfolio

A simple and production-like API designed for actual freelance projects.  
Includes layers for routing/service separation, Dockerization, and EC2 deployment.

🔹 技術ポイント  
- REST API 設計  
- Flask でのモジュール分割  
- Docker 化・docker-compose  
- AWS EC2 での実運用

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On Now

- Expanding portfolio-quality APIs  
- Adding new endpoints & CRUD examples  
- Improving reliability for SRE-oriented learning  
- Preparing to apply for API / Backend freelance work  
- Building workflows & documentation usable for real案件

## 🎯 My Goal

To secure **API / Backend / Web system** side-job opportunities  
and create a strong, reproducible portfolio that demonstrates  
real-world skills from development → containerization → deployment.
